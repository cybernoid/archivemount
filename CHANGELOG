* 0.9.1   - Incorporated fixes for compilation problems with newer gcc
            versions. Contributed by Niels de Vos
* 0.9.0   - Make sure the written archive's format is the same or as
            close as possible to the original. Due to a bug written files
            were always in ustar format. Contributed by Jeff Ebert.
          - Add AM_PROG_CC_C_O macro to configure.ac, contributed by
            Jeff Ebert
          - added option -o password, contributed by Scott Worley
          - Pass REG_ENHANCED to regcomp where available (Mac and BSD).
            Otherwise \? has no special meaning. Contributed by Michael
            J. Walsh
          - Removed magic number for block size, it's a constant now.
            Contributed by John Delgado
* 0.8.12  - changed naming scheme of temporary files to avoid running
            into too long names for the filesystem in /tmp
          - fixed renaming a newly created file (it got saved under its
            original name)
          - activated code for creating symlinks; in old versions, symlinks
            were not saved, presumably due to a bug in libarchive, but it
            seems to work now.
* 0.8.11  - fixed accidentally broken renaming of files
* 0.8.10  - fixed renaming of directories, it did not work at all anymore
* 0.8.9   - fixed wrong insert into tree when a subdir had the same name as its
            parent dir
* 0.8.8   - fixed bug when creating a new file and moving it over an old one,
            happens e.g. when saving a file from the geany editor
* 0.8.7   - contribution by KAICHO:
            * fixup to 0.8.6: corrected an ifdef
* 0.8.6   - contribution by KAICHO:
            * adaptions for CentOS, RHEL and Scientific Linux

          - contributions by Alain Parmentier:
            * FormatRaw optimization
            * bugfix : use of off_t to support 64bits
* 0.8.4   - added option -o formatraw for readonly support of the FormatRaw
            archive files supported by libarchive (kudos to Lee Leahu)
          - bugfix: do not do the fuse mount when the archive cannot be read
            (also kudos to Lee Leahu)
* 0.8.3   - do not call fuse_main anymore
          - force fuse into single-threaded mode due to libarchive not being
            thread-safe
          Both patches contributed by Timothy Hobbs <timothyhobbs@seznam.cz>,
          who found them in the Fedora RPM.

* 0.8.1   - added missing header file
* 0.8.0   - contributions by Tomáš Čech <sleep_walker@suse.cz>:

            * autoconf/automake support
            * bug reports and fixes for mac-fuse
            many thanks for this!
* 0.5.3   - bugfix: copying a file into a mounted archive failed when target
            existed and was not modified before. Fixed that.

            the directory entry itself

            be resolved into a user/group name, the previous version crashed
